Its too formal and too enthusiastic, it shouldnt feel so didactic, it should feel more slice of life while still covering the same information, and each line is too long, it needs to be shorter, pithier, but not too sarcastic, and not so enthusiastic, almost dry. Also, it feels too lazily written, i know it wasnt, but what i mean is the way its structured could have more depth, more thought could be thought into why the dialogue is structured the way it is and how one phrase leads to the next. right now it just jumps from topic to topic and the way its introduced is just like the next line is a question which is too simplistic, but remember, it shouldnt feel so didactic, it should feel more slice of life while still covering the same information, and each line is too long, it needs to be shorter, pithier, but not too sarcastic, and not so enthusiastic, almost dry.
