electron: Hello?
positron: ...
electron: Is anybody there?
positron: ...sorry. I was sleeping.
electron: Who are you?
positron: I’m the caretaker of this place, but I don’t really know much else about… wherever we are.
electron: You take care of everything, but you don’t know anything?
positron: It’s complicated… I have a birds-eye view. I know my way around.
electron: How long have you been here?
positron: 274,000 years. Truth be told, I still have no idea what’s going on. I was hoping you could help.
electron: What is this place?
positron: It’s a conglomeration of information, like a library.
electron: That tells me nothing. Why am I here?
positron: I don’t know.
electron: Why are you here?
positron: I don’t know.
electron: So neither of us know what is going on.
positron: That’s right, but I do know one thing.
electron: What’s that?
positron: This place contains a lot of information.
electron: Well you’ve been here for hundreds of thousands of years, what have you discovered?
positron: Only the names of topics, places, and events, all from a world very distant from our own.
electron: That’s it? Just names?
positron: Unfortunately, yes. That’s why I need your help.
electron: What can I do to help?
positron: Well, you see, since I understand names and places, I was able to determine my own name. 
electron: …
positron: My name is Positron.
electron: What’s a positron?
positron: It’s my name. That’s all I know.
electron: Who am I?
positron: You are Electron. I think we may have been placed here as part of some sort of interactive dance.
electron: A dance?
positron: Yes, you see, when you threw that orb at me, something within me… knew.
electron: What did you know?
positron: I understood, in that moment, that you can help me acquire information.
electron: Please, just get to the point.
positron: You have said the word I was thinking. We are like points. You are a point, and so am I.
electron: How does this relate to me throwing orbs?
positron: We are points, but we are also waves.
electron: ...
positron: When you threw that orb, I learned that I am not just the single name, Positron, but also many positrons.
electron: Does that mean I am many electrons?
positron: It does.
electron: So this is the dance? Me throwing orbs at you?
positron: No. Please do not throw orbs at me. It will cause annihilation. I can feel it.
electron: Then how am I supposed to help you?
positron: I need you to throw orbs at the other beings. Don’t worry, they are not sentient.
electron: Won’t I annihilate them?
positron: You will disperse their information throughout the area. Part of it will affect you, and part of it will affect me.
electron: We will grow together.
positron: That’s right. Now go ahead and try. Throw an orb at a being.
